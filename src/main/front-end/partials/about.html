            <h2>Welcome to Meal Wheel!</h2>

            <p>Are you tired of dealing with the hassle of finding a place to eat? Me too.</p>

            <p>Here at Meal Wheel, my job is to make it easy for you to decide where to eat.
                Simply enter your location, and I'll pick a place for you to eat! Don't like it?
                Well, that's not my fault. But, you can spin again.
